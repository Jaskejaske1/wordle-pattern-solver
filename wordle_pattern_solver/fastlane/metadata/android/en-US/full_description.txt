A utility to help you create Wordle pattern art.

Unlike a standard solver, this app lets you:
1. Set a "Target Word" (the answer).
2. Enter "Guess Words" on the grid.
3. See exactly what colors would result.

This allows you to engineer specific patterns (like a checkerboard or shape) to share with friends.

Features:
* Visualise how guesses look against a target word
* Fetches today's NYT answer to test patterns against it
* Save your favorite designs/patterns
* Works great on phones and tablets

Completely free and open source. No ads, no tracking.
