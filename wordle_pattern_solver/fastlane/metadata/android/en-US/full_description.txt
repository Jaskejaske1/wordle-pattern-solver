A utility to help you create Wordle pattern art.
<br><br>
Unlike a standard solver, this app lets you:
<br>1. Set a "Target Word" (the answer).
<br>2. Enter "Guess Words" on the grid.
<br>3. See exactly what colors would result.
<br><br>
This allows you to engineer specific patterns (like a checkerboard or shape) to share with friends.
<br><br>
Features:
<br>• <b>Pattern Simulator</b>: Visualise how guesses look against a target
<br>• <b>Daily Solution</b>: Fetches today's NYT answer to test patterns against it
<br>• <b>Saved Patterns</b>: Save your favorite designs/patterns
<br>• <b>No Ads, No Tracking</b>d open source. No ads, no tracking.
